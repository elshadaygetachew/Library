# A simple web-based library management system  On Ruby For DBA 
 
Basic requirements:
•	Data entry: Each record must consist of at least 4 data fields, including book title, author(s), ISBN and Publisher. Other relevant fields may also be implemented.

  1.Librarian – a display containing a web form for allowing data entry

  2.Library users - a general “higher-level” display for showing a list of currently available books


•	Security:allow only permitted users (i.e. the librarian only, not public library users) to edit the records.
